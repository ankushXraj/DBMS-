# RETRIEVING DATA (Functions & Aggregates)

## 1. Compute number of days remaining in this year

```sql
SELECT DATEDIFF(
    MAKEDATE(YEAR(CURDATE()) + 1, 1),
    CURDATE()
) AS days_remaining;
```

Logic → Next year first day − today

## 2. Highest salary, Lowest salary & Difference

```sql
SELECT
    MAX(sal) AS highest_salary,
    MIN(sal) AS lowest_salary,
    MAX(sal) - MIN(sal) AS difference
FROM employee;
```

## 3. Employees whose commission > 25% of salary

```sql
SELECT ename, sal, comm FROM employee
WHERE comm > sal * 0.25;
```

## 4. Display salary in Dollar format

```sql
SELECT ename, CONCAT('$', sal) AS salary FROM employee;
```

MySQL uses CONCAT, Oracle uses formatting functions

## 5. Matrix Query (Pivot Style) Salary per job based on department

```sql
SELECT
    job,
    SUM(CASE WHEN deptno = 10 THEN sal ELSE 0 END) AS dept10,
    SUM(CASE WHEN deptno = 20 THEN sal ELSE 0 END) AS dept20,
    SUM(CASE WHEN deptno = 30 THEN sal ELSE 0 END) AS dept30,
    SUM(CASE WHEN deptno = 40 THEN sal ELSE 0 END) AS dept40,
    SUM(sal) AS total_salary
FROM employee
GROUP BY job;
```
Very common exam favourite

## 6. Total employees & employees hired per year

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
    SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(hiredate)=1980 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS y1980,
    SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(hiredate)=1981 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS y1981,
    SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(hiredate)=1982 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS y1982,
    SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(hiredate)=1983 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS y1983
FROM employee;
```

## 7. Query to get Last Sunday of Any Month Example → February 2026

```sql
SELECT DATE_SUB(
    LAST_DAY('2026-02-01'),
    INTERVAL (DAYOFWEEK(LAST_DAY('2026-02-01')) - 1) DAY
) AS last_sunday;
```
Change month easily

## 8. Department numbers & total employees per department

```sql
SELECT deptno, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employee
GROUP BY deptno;
```

## 9. Jobs & total employees per job

```sql
SELECT job, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employee
GROUP BY job;
```

## 10. Department numbers & total salary per department

```sql
SELECT deptno, SUM(sal) AS total_salary FROM employee
GROUP BY deptno;
```
